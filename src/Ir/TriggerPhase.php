 * A throw there rolls back the entire commit, and mutation is forbidden so the
 * in-transaction path stays a single pass with no cascades.
 *
 * PostCommit runs once the transaction is closed. A throw is logged and the remaining
 * triggers still run. Mutation is allowed, because a write there is simply a new unit
 * of work rather than an extension of the current one.
